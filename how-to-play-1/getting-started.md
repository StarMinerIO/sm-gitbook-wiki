# Getting started

  
The requirements to start playing StarMiner are a Binance Smart Chain compatible wallet such as MetaMask, and BNB to be used for purchasing ORE and to pay for gas fees.

MetaMask can be installed as a browser extension, or as an application on your mobile devices.

The instructions to install MetaMask can be found here:

Once your MetaMask wallet has been setup, instructions to purchase ORE on a DEX can be found here:
