# Introduction

StarMiner is a Play To Earn NFT mining game built on the Binance Smart Chain.

In the near future, with the rapid development of technology and population explosion, human beings start to break out of the solar system and explore the universe. In order to explore space, human beings need to build a large number of spaceships and have a large demand for minerals. Some special metals only exist in meteorites, so interstellar mining becomes very profitable, and a large number of interstellar miner robots are sent to space to carry out mining operations.

To start mining, you need to buy the Miner Box for a Miner NFT. After collecting enough Power, your miner can start mining to get profit for you.
