# Introduction

StarMiner is a Play-to-Earn NFT mining game built on the Binance Smart Chain platform. The game revolves around gaining ore resources by acquiring miners to mine. Players can use their assets to buy miners, enter space, and earn ORE Token. StarMiner Characters are NFTs owned by players and minted according to the ERC-721 standard, which can be exchanged on the proprietary market.

In the near future, with the rapid development of technology and population explosion, human beings start to break out of the solar system and explore the universe. In order to explore space, human beings need to build a large number of spaceships and have a large demand for minerals. Some special metals only exist in meteorites, so interstellar mining becomes very profitable, and a large number of interstellar miner robots are sent to space to carry out mining operations.

To start mining, you need to buy the Miner Box for a Miner NFT. After collecting enough Power, your miner can start mining to get profit for you.
