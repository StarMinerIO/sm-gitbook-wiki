# Staking

The Power can be recovered automatically, and miners can also speed up the recovery process by adding ORE-BNB LPs.

Steps:

1. Get enough OREs \(check the number of OREs you need to stake in the staking page\)
2. Add ORE-BNB liquidity to PancakeSwap
3. Visit the staking page, select the Miner you want to accelerate, click Boost, and select the LPs.

For Miners with different rarities, the number of LPs that need to be staked is also different.
